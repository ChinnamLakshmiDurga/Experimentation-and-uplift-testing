# Experimentation-and-uplift-testing
## Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program_Task-2
### Description:
Being a part of Quantiumâ€™s retail analytics team, we have been approached by a client, the Category Manager for Chips, who has asked us to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.
### Overall outline of the task:
ðŸŽ¯ **Select control stores** â€“ Exploring the data and define metrics for our control store selection â€“ thinking about what would make them a control store. Looking at the drivers and making sure we visualise these in a graph to better determine if they are suited. For this piece it may even be worth creating a function to help us. 

ðŸŽ¯ **Assessment of the trial** â€“ This one should give us some interesting insights into each of the stores, checking each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance. We want to know if the trial stores were successful or not. 

ðŸŽ¯ **Collate findings** â€“ Summarise our findings for each store and provide an recommendation that we can share outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.
